Introduction\n","This report has been prepared as a requirement of Smart Industry Operations course. This is related to an individual assignment where we are required to help Variass (manufacturer and supplier of advanced electronics parts to different industries) in predicting the defect rates of assembled products based on their specifications. Variass has provided us four (04) data files that will be needed and helpful in this assignment.\n","\n","In this assignment, firstly, we need to check the data that have been provided to us, clean the data where it is needed and make those data suitable to be used for further analysis.\n","\n","Then we need to determine the defect rates returned by the automated inspection system on the overall and per defect type. We also need to find the true defect rates and false calls’ rate in this step.\n","\n","Then we need to develop  a  single  model  that  predicts  the  defect  rate  per  two  specific  defect  types. We also need to split the data in two portions where 80% of the inspection data should be used for training and the rest 20% should be used for testing for validation.\n","\n","So in this report, the above mentioned order has been followed and the report is comprised of the following chapters sequentially:\n","\n","•\tIntroduction (current section)\n","\n","•\tData Cleaning and Preparation\n","\n","•\tEstimation of Defect Rates\n","\n","•\tPrediction and Performance Reporting\n","\n","•\tRecommendation and Conclusion\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"HDi0yuPr1X9E"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 2.

The number of defected parts cannot be greater than the total number of manufactured parts.

However, this is something that definitely needs explanation.\n","\n","Then, another point to mention is that the part numbers and their VPL package codes were found not as unique. Some part numbers have more that one VPL package code which created difficulties in calculations.\n","\n","For example, for part number CAX-00001, we got two VPL codes as PBXC-G60/MB-L172W40T25 and PDXC-G62/MB-L189W56T21.

we get similar results for 'Rotate' defect type also. We find that MAE, MSE and RMSE values are considerably close to zero. Therefore, based on these three metrices it seems that the regression model can be considered as a good fit. But at the same time, we get a negative value for the R-square value (Coefficient of determination) which indicates that the chosen model does not follow the trend of the data. And also from the graph it is evident that, the regresion line cannot be considered to be a good fit."],"metadata":{"id":"HZ89a2ayv-Of"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 5. Recommendation and Conclusion\n","\n","\n","\n","In this assignment, with a view to helping Variass, we have determined the defects detection rate of the manufactured electronic parts based on various metrices. Then we have also tried to predict if the defects type have any relationships with the physical specifications of the parts. In this process, we have used the \"Decision tree\" regression since it was found to be able to predict the defect rates best when compared with other regression models.\n","\n","The findings and recommendations are summarized below:\n","\n","1. The five parts' with highest defect rates detected by the AOI machine are mentioned below with their following VPL package codes:\n","\n","  PDXC-F2/XS-L328W160T75\n","  \n","  MSXC-F11/NU-L75W50T25\n","  \n","  PDXS-G4/HD-L73W79T91\n","  \n","  PSXC-N3/HH-L76W18T65\n","  \n","  PQFP-N21/MX-L30W30T6\n","\n","\n","2. Only 0.11% of the total manufactured parts were found to be with defects by the AOI machine which is very small. So the overall manufacturing process can be considered to be sufficiently efficient.\n","\n","3. The probability that the AOI machine will correctly detect defects in all manufactured parts is 0.76 which means the AOI mahcine, on average, makes one error in every four detected items. If the accuracy of this machine can be improved, then it may result in higher available machine and human hours.\n","\n","4. \"InsufficientSolder\" and \"Missing\" are the two most frequently detected defect types by the AOI machine. So measures should be taken to avoid these defects during the production precoess.\n","\n","5. The  prediction by the AOI machine is highest successfull for the defect type \"LiftedSolder\" where all the reviewed parts were actually found to be with defects. Apart from this defect type, \"DoubleChip\", \"InsufficientSolder\", \"OutofArea\", \"PinHole\" also have successful detection rates over 90%.\n","\n","To conclude, I would say that this assignment had been an excellent opportunity for me to explore and learn various avenues of python programming and big data handling and analysis through solving a real life problem. It is always fun and very effective to learn through solving projects inspired from real life problems.\n","\n","I firmly believe that the interest which this course has created inside me towards python programming and solving operations management problems using different programming tools will definitely keep pushing me to explore more and more realms of technology.
